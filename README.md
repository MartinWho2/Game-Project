Game-Project
============

This program is a RTS open-map game which happens during WWI. <br> 
The project is much inspired by the game "Mindustry" from Anuke. <br>
The aim of the project is to learn how to code in python with pygame. <br>
More informations are available with the file Game_ideas.docx <br>
If you have any suggestions, we would be very happy to hear them. <br>

## setup

You first need to clone the game in one of your repository.

If you haven't downloaded python on your computer yet, you need to download it here : 
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Make sure to dowload the 3.9 version.

If you already have python, but you do not have the 3.9 version, make sure to upgrade it with :

Windows:
```
pip install python --upgrade
```
Mac :
```
brew install python3
```
You also need to download the 2.0 pygame package, if you don't own it already:

Windows:
```
pip install pygame==2.0
```
Mac :
```
python -m pip install pygame==2.0
```
You now need to go in the repository where you stocked the code

You can now run the code :

Windows:
```
